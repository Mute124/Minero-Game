The advantage of function objects over pointers to functions is that the objects in the standard library declare nested typedefs describing their argument and result types with uniform names (e.\+g., {\ttfamily result\+\_\+type} from the base classes {\ttfamily unary\+\_\+function} and {\ttfamily binary\+\_\+function}). Sometimes those typedefs are required, not just optional.

Adaptors are provided to turn pointers to unary (single-\/argument) and binary (double-\/argument) functions into function objects. The long-\/winded functor {\ttfamily pointer\+\_\+to\+\_\+unary\+\_\+function} is constructed with a function pointer {\ttfamily f}, and its {\ttfamily operator()} called with argument {\ttfamily x} returns {\ttfamily \doxylink{_classes_2lib_2raylib_2src_2external_2glad_8h_a0fdda94b8b7e64884690244028f455ba}{f(x)}}. The functor {\ttfamily pointer\+\_\+to\+\_\+binary\+\_\+function} does the same thing, but with a double-\/argument {\ttfamily f} and {\ttfamily operator()}.

The function {\ttfamily ptr\+\_\+fun} takes a pointer-\/to-\/function {\ttfamily f} and constructs an instance of the appropriate functor.
