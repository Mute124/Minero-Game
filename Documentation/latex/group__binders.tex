Binders turn functions/functors with two arguments into functors with a single argument, storing an argument to be applied later. For example, a variable {\ttfamily B} of type {\ttfamily binder1st} is constructed from a functor {\ttfamily f} and an argument {\ttfamily x}. Later, B\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily operator()} is called with a single argument {\ttfamily y}. The return value is the value of {\ttfamily \doxylink{_classes_2lib_2raylib_2src_2external_2glad_8h_a0fdda94b8b7e64884690244028f455ba}{f(x,y)}}. {\ttfamily B} can be {\itshape called} with various arguments (y1, y2, ...) and will in turn call {\ttfamily \doxylink{_classes_2lib_2raylib_2src_2external_2glad_8h_a0fdda94b8b7e64884690244028f455ba}{f(x,y1)}}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{_classes_2lib_2raylib_2src_2external_2glad_8h_a0fdda94b8b7e64884690244028f455ba}{f(x,y2)}}, ...

The function {\ttfamily bind1st} is provided to save some typing. It takes the function and an argument as parameters, and returns an instance of {\ttfamily binder1st}.

The type {\ttfamily binder2nd} and its creator function {\ttfamily bind2nd} do the same thing, but the stored argument is passed as the second parameter instead of the first, e.\+g., {\ttfamily bind2nd}(std\+::minus$<$float$>$(),1.\+3) will create a functor whose {\ttfamily operator()} accepts a floating-\/point number, subtracts 1.\+3 from it, and returns the result. (If {\ttfamily bind1st} had been used, the functor would perform {\itshape 1.\+3 -\/ x} instead.

Creator-\/wrapper functions like {\ttfamily bind1st} are intended to be used in calling algorithms. Their return values will be temporary objects. (The goal is to not require you to type names like {\ttfamily std\+::binder1st$<$std\+::plus$<$int$>$$>$} for declaring a variable to hold the return value from {\ttfamily bind1st(std\+::plus$<$int$>$(),5)}.

These become more useful when combined with the composition functions.

These functions are deprecated in C++11 and can be replaced by {\ttfamily std\+::bind} (or {\ttfamily std\+::tr1\+::bind}) which is more powerful and flexible, supporting functions with any number of arguments. Uses of {\ttfamily bind1st} can be replaced by {\ttfamily std\+::bind(f, x, std\+::placeholders\+::\+\_\+1)} and {\ttfamily bind2nd} by {\ttfamily std\+::bind(f, std\+::placeholders\+::\+\_\+1, x)}.
