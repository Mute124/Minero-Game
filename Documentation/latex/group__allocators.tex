An allocator that uses global new, as per C++03 \mbox{[}20.\+4.\+1\mbox{]}.

This is precisely the allocator defined in the C++ Standard.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item all allocation calls operator new
\item all deallocation calls operator delete
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyTemplParams}{Template Parameters}
{\em \+\_\+\+Tp} & Type of allocated object.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyTemplParams}
Uniform interface to C++98 and C++11 allocators.

A meta-\/allocator with debugging bits.

This is precisely the allocator defined in the C++03 Standard.

An example allocator which uses a non-\/standard pointer type.

This allocator specifies that containers use a \textquotesingle{}relative pointer\textquotesingle{} as it\textquotesingle{}s pointer type. (See ext/pointer.\+h) Memory allocation in this example is still performed using std\+::allocator.

An allocator that uses malloc.

This is precisely the allocator defined in the C++ Standard.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item all allocation calls malloc
\item all deallocation calls free
\end{DoxyItemize}

Base class for pool object.

Data describing the underlying memory pool, parameterized on threading support.

Specialization for single thread.

Policy for shared \+\_\+\+\_\+pool objects.

Policy for individual \+\_\+\+\_\+pool objects.

Base class for \+\_\+\+Tp dependent member functions.

This is a fixed size (power of 2) allocator which -\/ when compiled with thread support -\/ will maintain one freelist per size per thread plus a {\itshape global} one. Steps are taken to limit the per thread freelist sizes (by returning excess back to the {\itshape global} list).

{\em \+\_\+\+Tp} & Type of allocated object.\\

\end{DoxyTemplParams}
Base class for \+\_\+\+\_\+pool\+\_\+alloc.

Uses various allocators to fulfill underlying requests (and makes as few requests as possible when in default high-\/speed pool mode).

Important implementation properties\+: 0. If globally mandated, then allocate objects from new
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If the clients request an object of size \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} \+\_\+\+S\+\_\+max\+\_\+bytes, the resulting object will be obtained directly from new
\item In all other cases, we allocate an object of size exactly \+\_\+\+S\+\_\+round\+\_\+up(requested\+\_\+size). Thus the client has enough size information that we can return the object to the proper free list without permanently losing part of the object.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Allocator using a memory pool with a single lock.

An allocator that uses global new, as per C++03 \mbox{[}20.\+4.\+1\mbox{]}.

This is precisely the allocator defined in the C++ Standard.
