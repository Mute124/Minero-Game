There are a total of 8 = 2\texorpdfstring{$^\wedge$}{\string^}3 function objects in this family. (1) Member functions taking no arguments vs member functions taking one argument. (2) Call through pointer vs call through reference. (3) Const vs non-\/const member function.

All of this complexity is in the function objects themselves. You can ignore it by using the helper function {\ttfamily mem\+\_\+fun} and {\ttfamily mem\+\_\+fun\+\_\+ref}, which create whichever type of adaptor is appropriate.

\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Deprecated}
\item[\mbox{\hyperlink{deprecated__deprecated000013}{Deprecated}}]Deprecated in C++11, no longer in the standard since C++17. Use {\ttfamily mem\+\_\+fn} instead.\end{DoxyRefDesc}
