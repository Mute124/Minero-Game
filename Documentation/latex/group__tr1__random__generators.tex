\doxysubsubsection{Detailed Description}
Produces random numbers on a given distribution function using a non-\/uniform random number generation engine.

\item[\mbox{\hyperlink{todo__todo000004}{Todo}}]the engine\+\_\+value\+\_\+type needs to be studied more carefully. \end{DoxyRefDesc}


Constructs a variate generator with the uniform random number generator {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+eng} for the random distribution {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+dist}.


\begin{DoxyExceptions}{Exceptions}
{\em Any} & exceptions which may thrown by the copy constructors of the {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+Engine} or {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+Dist} objects.\\

\end{DoxyExceptions}
Gets the next generated value on the distribution.

Gets a reference to the underlying uniform random number generator object.

Gets a const reference to the underlying uniform random number generator object.

Gets a reference to the underlying random distribution.

Gets a const reference to the underlying random distribution.

Gets the closed lower bound of the distribution interval.

Gets the closed upper bound of the distribution interval.

These classes define objects which provide random or pseudorandom numbers, either from a discrete or a continuous interval. The random number generator supplied as a part of this library are all uniform random number generators which provide a sequence of random number uniformly distributed over their range.

A number generator is a function object with an operator() that takes zero arguments and returns a number.

A compliant random number generator must satisfy the following requirements.
